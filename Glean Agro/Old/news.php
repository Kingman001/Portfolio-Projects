                        Nigerians are being pinched by rising food prices where it hurts the most: Rice, the main ingredient for making jollof, a popular delicacy in many Nigerian homes, jumped 61% in September.

                        A kilogram of the local variety of the ingredient sold for 757 naira in September from 471 naira a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Monday.

                        Analysts see Nigeria’s 2023 grain production declining

                <div class="news--body">
                    <p class="text-wrapped-3">
                        Analysts at AFEX have predicted a decline in grain production in Africa’s most populous country in 2023 over the continuous surge in production costs and erratic climate conditions.
                        They also forecasted that food inflation could further worsen in 2023, and household misery increase, as the production outlook of paddy rice, maize, sesame, and cocoa declined by an average of 11.5 percent in 2022/23 trading season.

                        The forecast is contained in AFEX’s 2023 Annual Commodity Review and Outlook Report unveiled at a virtual meeting held recently.
